#### 该仓库的代码均为本人大一在校学习C++期间利用课余时间完成的C++作品，初次接触面向对象编程不久，因此代码较为粗糙。上传于此仅为保留自己的编程印迹。希望有兴趣查看的朋友能忍受如此臃肿的代码。

#### All the codes in this warehouse are C++ works completed by me in my spare time when I was studying C++ in my freshman year. Since I first came into contact with object-oriented programming not long ago, the code is relatively rough.Upload it here just to keep your programming footprint.I hope those of you who are interested in watching can put up with such bloated code
